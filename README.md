A Sudoku based final year university project.

My final year univesity project. The official title was Logical Visualisation using Sudoku.

It's a sudoku solver using a SAT solver. The logical rules of sudoku (no two of the same number on a line, etc) and the current board state are coverted to the DIMACS logical format and a victory state (if possible) is found.

It has both command line and GUI interfaces, and is capable of generating and solving sudoku puzzles of any size.

Despite several features being unfinished it is still a fully functional (if a little unoptimized) solver.
